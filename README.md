# FFC Quality Assurance Engineer Interview



## Purpose

The purpose of this repo is to have interviewees be able to look over Cypress cucumber code in a semi-real world setup. The main branch should be kept clean and readable.



## Interview

You will be given a link to a specific pull request(PR). You will walk through the PR with a developer. Your job is to comment on and question the code within the PR.

* If you don't know what something does, ask.

* If something looks wrong, bring it up. Help brainstorm potential alternative solutions.

* If you have an opinion, state it.



## Developer

Try to answer any questions the interviewee asks about the PR.

Keep the main branch clean and free of any and all secrets.
